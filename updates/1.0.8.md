# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Fixed an error for picking up placed objects (`IsBuildable`) **ONLY** and implemented a new configuration option on `Ingredients` for the specified types which is called `return_quantity`. This new option is to return the item quantities on pickup after building them in case a server owner wants to not waste all the resources on pickup and get nothing.

On the configuration, where there are `IsBuildable` crafts, this is how `Ingredients` should be:

```lua
    Ingredients = { 
        { item = 'rock', required_quantity = 6, return_quantity = 3 }, -- return_quantity only for buildables.
        { item = 'wooden_sticks', required_quantity = 6, return_quantity = 3 }, -- return_quantity only for buildables.
    },
```
